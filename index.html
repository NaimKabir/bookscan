        bookscan.app is the spiritual successor to certain benign tools that were used
        solely to provide descriptive statistics and sentiment analysis on works of prose.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a key difference: this application is intentionally spiteful. It was trained specifically on the prose
        works of <a href="https://twitter.com/ZachRoseWriter/status/1688561466356486145?s=20">every author</a> that jumped onto the internet dogpile that got this tool
        taken off the internet without any inspection of the intent nor the underlying technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of being purely descriptive, this application is <em>generative</em>, and allows anyone to effortlessly
        imitate the style and content of these authors just by clicking the 'Generate' button below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give it a try!
